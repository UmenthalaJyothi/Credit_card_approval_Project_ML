# Credit_card_approval_Project_ML

# Project Description:
This project aims to predict the likelihood of credit card approval based on various features of the applicant.
The project uses a machine learning algorithm to classify whether an application is approved or rejected.

# Data:
The dataset used in this project contains 1548 instances and 19 attributes. 
The data was preprocessed by removing missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and scaling the features.
Cleaned dataset Contains 1316 instances and 18 attributes.

# Models:
Used various classification models like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine.
The parameters were tuned using hyperparameter tuning and the performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.
